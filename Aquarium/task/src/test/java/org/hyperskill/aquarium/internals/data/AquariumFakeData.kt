        //Koi Carp
        "These colorful, ornamental fish are a variety of the Amur carp. " +
                "They were originally found in Central Europe and Asia, " +
                "but they’ve spread to many other parts of the world. " +
                "Koi carp are popular with breeders, and there are currently over 100 varieties " +
                "created through breeding.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "The average age of a koi carp can vary based on the part of the world it’s bred in. " +
                "Carps bred outside of Japan have an average lifespan of around 15 years," +
                " while carps bred in Japan can live 40 years or more. The oldest koi carp on record," +
                " which was a fish named Hanako, reportedly lived for 226 years!",
        // Spiny dogfish
        "The spiny dogfish is a type of shark with venomous spines in front of its dorsal fins." +
                " Not only is it an aggressive hunter, but these fish are known to hunt in packs!" +
                " Like many shark species, these fish grow slowly, " +
                "and some females don’t reach full maturity until they’re over 30 years old.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "While the lifespan of the spiny dogfish is already impressive, " +
                "some fish live for far longer than average. " +
                "Spiny dogfish in the Pacific Ocean tend to live longer than fish in the Atlantic," +
                " with some fish living longer than 80 years. " +
                "Females tend to mature later than males, and they usually live longer too.",
        //Kaluga
        "Sometimes called the river beluga, the kaluga is a type of predatory sturgeon." +
                " While these fish spend the majority of their time in freshwater, " +
                "they’re also able to survive in salt water. " +
                "The kaluga is one of the world’s largest freshwater fish species and can grow to be more than 18 feet long, " +
                "with a weight of over 2,200 pounds.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Kalugas are overfished, which has left the species vulnerable to extinction. " +
                "Although many kaluga are killed before they fully mature, " +
                "these fish have the potential to live very long lives. " +
                "One kaluga that was caught in China is estimated to be over 100 years old."
